    "# 📊 Workspace for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use either JupyterLab or VisualStudio Code through your browser to access the workspace, switch to VSCode by clicking on its button on the JupyterLab Launcher page.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 📥️ Install dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend to store the dependencies you install in files in a persistently saved folder (e.g. `env.yml`, `requirements.txt`) to reinstall everything easily in case the container is restarted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐍 Install conda packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `conda` or `mamba` to install conda packages. Mamba is a reimplementation of conda in C++ that makes it much faster, every commands used in conda work in mamba, you just need to replace conda by mamba at the start of the command. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example to install plotly using mamba, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba install plotly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ If `mamba` does not work for you, then use `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to use a different Python version than the one used by default in the container you can create a new environment with the Python version you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to use an older version Python like 3.8 in a new conda environment named `py38`, your `env.yml` should look like this, you can add more conda and pip packages to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: py38\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "  - conda-forge\n",
    "dependencies:\n",
    "  - python=3.8\n",
    "  - ipykernel \n",
    "  - pip\n",
    "  - pip:\n",
    "    - your-pip-package\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your environment has been defined, you can create it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba env create -f env.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ You cannot use `conda activate` in a Docker container, so you will need to create a new tile which will use the kernel from your conda environment. Running the following command will create the tile on the JupyterLab launcher page:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda run -n py38 python -m ipykernel install --user --name py38 --display-name \"Python 3.8 (py38)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify you are using the right kernel you can run the following inside your notebook opened through the tile with using the kernel from your conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "!{sys.executable} --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output based on our example `env.yml` should be a version of Python 3.8: \"Python 3.8.X\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Or use `conda run` to run scripts and/or commands directly using the new environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba run -n py38 python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐍 Install pip packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Python packages with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦️ Install apt packages\n",
    "\n",
    "If `sudo` has been enabled in the container you can install packages with the `apt` package manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install -y wget\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
